====================================
Installing (as a RoboFont Extension) 
====================================

Since July 2013, hTools2 is also available as a RoboFont Extension.

To install the Extension, simply `download hTools2 from github`_, unzip the archive, and double-click the file ``hTools2.roboFontExt``.

.. _download hTools2 from github : https://github.com/gferreira/hTools2/archive/dev.zip

The extension will install itself automatically, and an ``hTools2`` entry will appear in RoboFont's main menu.

Which installation method?
--------------------------

Each installation method has its advantages and disadvantages.

The Extension is super easy to install (one click). But following this approach, the ``hTools2`` module will becomes available only for RoboFont -- and not for Python in Terminal or NodeBox.
