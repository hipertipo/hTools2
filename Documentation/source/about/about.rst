``hTools2`` is a collection of tools and objects for type-design & font-production work. It is written in Python_ and specially tailored for use with RoboFont_. The core Python modules and objects can also be used with `FontLab Studio`_ and ‘NoneLab’ (pure Python).

.. _FontLab Studio: http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/

``hTools2`` is built with RoboFab_ and vanilla_. It uses the UFO_ font format to store font sources, and plist_ files to store different kinds of font data.
